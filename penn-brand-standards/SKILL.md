name: penn-brand-standards
description: Apply the official University of Pennsylvania (Penn) brand standards when creating or reviewing any Penn-branded work — websites, web pages, HTML emails, documents, presentations, posters, letterhead, business cards, merchandise mockups. Covers Penn Red #990000 and Penn Blue #011F5B, the web accent palette, official typography (EB Garamond/Roboto on the web, Perpetua/ITC Stone Serif for the identity), logo variants and usage rules, stationery specs, and required web footer links. Use whenever the user mentions Penn, UPenn, University of Pennsylvania, Quakers, or asks for Penn-branded / red-and-blue university styling — even if they don't say "brand".

# Penn Brand Standards

Official source: https://branding.web-resources.upenn.edu (Brand Guidelines PDF updated Aug 13, 2025). Everything below is derived from that site. When you follow these rules the output is brand-compliant; when a request conflicts with them, flag the conflict and cite the rule — do not silently improvise on the identity.

Exceptions to these standards are rare. A small number apply based on how centers and departments are funded or represented. Never assume, suggest, or invent an exception, and never treat the possibility of one as a reason to depart from the standards: apply them as written and flag any deviation. If someone believes an exception covers their center or department, direct them to University Communications (ucomms-web@upenn.edu) to confirm.

## 1. Colors

Penn's identity is built on two official colors. Everything else is support.

### Core brand colors

| Color | Hex | RGB | CMYK (print) | Pantone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Penn Red** | `#990000` | 153, 0, 0 | 24, 100, 100, 25 | PMS 201 |
| **Penn Blue** | `#011F5B` | 1, 31, 91 | 100, 93, 32, 32 | PMS 288 |

Never substitute "close" reds or blues (no `#011F5B` → navy approximations, no bright reds). Web and print values are **not** interchangeable — use hex/RGB for screens, CMYK/PMS for print. Print values used on screen look washed out and degrade the brand.

### Web accent palette

For web and digital work only. Penn Red and Blue dominate; the rest are accents used sparingly.

| Color | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Penn Blue | `#011F5B` | Dominant — headers, footers, primary UI |
| Penn Red | `#990000` | One of the two dominant brand colors; used for emphasis, links, calls to action |
| Black | `#000000` | Body text |
| Light blue | `#82AFD3` | Accent only |
| Gold | `#F2C100` | Accent only |
| Light gray | `#F7F7F7` / `#F2F2F2` | Backgrounds |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds, reversed text |

Rough usage ratio on Penn's central web identity: blue ≈ half of all color, red well behind it, neutrals for most surfaces, light blue and gold only as small accents. When in doubt, go blue-dominant with red highlights on white/light-gray.

Gold and light blue are **web/digital accent colors only** — the guidelines define no PMS/CMYK values for them, so for print accents confirm an approved spec with University Communications (ucomms-web@upenn.edu) rather than picking a Pantone. Both are low-contrast on white; Penn's own pages use them as non-text accents (rules, borders, highlights), not as body-text colors on light backgrounds.

### Logo color rule

The logo may appear in **full color (red + blue), black, white, or Penn blue only**. No other logo color is acceptable. ("Discolored" logos are explicitly listed as incorrect usage.)

## 2. Typography

Penn uses different typefaces for the *identity* (logo, stationery) and for the *web*. Pick by medium:

| Medium | Typeface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web (body & headings) | **EB Garamond** | Primary web typeface, used most frequently. Free via Google Fonts. |
| Web (accents/contrast) | **Roboto** | Used sparingly for style and contrast. Weights on Penn's own site: 400, 400 italic, 500, 700, 700 italic. Free via Google Fonts. |
| Logo / identity | **Perpetua** | Renders the "Penn" mark. Licensed (MyFonts) — never substitute for the actual mark. |
| Logo / stationery | **ITC Stone Serif** (+ Italic) | Renders the "University of Pennsylvania" logotype and all stationery text. Licensed (MyFonts). |

Web font embed used by Penn's own site:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=EB+Garamond|Roboto:400,400i,500,700,700i&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

For stationery text sizes (business cards, letterhead), see `references/stationery-and-print.md`.

If a licensed font is unavailable (e.g., quick HTML mockups), use EB Garamond as the stand-in serif — do not recreate the Penn mark or logotype in a substitute font; use official logo assets instead.

## 3. Logo essentials

The full Penn logo = **University Shield + Penn Mark + "University of Pennsylvania" logotype**. (The **Penn Mark** is the "Penn" wordmark set in Perpetua — it's a component of the logo, never a standalone asset.)

- **Variants**: full logo; simplified logo (shield + mark, no logotype); shield alone; vertical stacked lockup; reversed (white) versions for dark/blue backgrounds; simplified shield (digital/wayfinding only, requires permission — email ucomms-web@upenn.edu).
- **Vertical lockup** is only for spaces too narrow for the minimum logo width. Default to horizontal.
- **Size**: minimum size is determined by legibility (no fixed mm/px minimum); no maximum size.
- **Spacing**: keep clear space around the logo free of all other elements; respect the logo's safe zone for alignment.
- **Files**: download official assets from https://branding.web-resources.upenn.edu/logos-and-branding/download-penn-logos (EPS/PNG/JPG; RGB files for digital, CMYK for print). Never rebuild, trace, or modify the logo.

**In generated code** (HTML/email/docs), reference the logo as a local file from the official download (e.g. `assets/img/penn-logo-reversed.png`); use the reversed variant on Penn Blue/dark headers and footers. There is no hotlinkable official logo URL — if the asset can't be bundled, leave a clearly marked placeholder with a comment pointing to the download page rather than a traced or text-drawn approximation.

**Never** (all listed as incorrect usage in the official guide): recolor the logo · change its proportions · stretch or distort it · reposition or separate its parts · use the Penn Mark on its own · use individual elements *of the shield's coat of arms* (the complete shield by itself **is** a sanctioned decorative variant) · overlay it on a patterned background that makes it illegible.

**Restricted symbols**: the University Seal is for Trustees-authorized documents only; the Split P is for Penn Athletics and spirit uses only; the shield with flourish/banner requires Office of the University Secretary permission.

For department/school lockups, co-branding, and student-group rules, read `references/logos-and-lockups.md`.

## 4. Web identity requirements

Applies to any page presented as an official Penn page:

1. Include a link back to https://www.upenn.edu
2. Include the Penn logo
3. Link to these five global resources (conventionally in the footer):
   - Privacy Policy — https://www.upenn.edu/about/privacy-policy
   - Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help — https://accessibility.web-resources.upenn.edu/get-help
   - Disclaimer — https://www.upenn.edu/about/disclaimer
   - Emergency Services — https://www.publicsafety.upenn.edu/contact/
   - Report Copyright Infringement — https://www.upenn.edu/about/report-copyright-infringement
4. Do **not** clone the look and feel of the Penn homepage — that design is reserved for top-level pages and University Communications sites. Schools/departments should follow the color and typographic standards above instead.
5. Comply with font licensing when developing online materials.

## 5. Use of name

- "University of Pennsylvania" is the full legal name; "Penn" is the sanctioned short form. Penn Carey Law: short form "Penn Carey Law", long form "University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School" (effective Sept 1, 2022).
- The University regulates use of its names, school/program names, shield, and insignia — oversight rests with the Office of the University Secretary (policy: https://secretary.upenn.edu/trustees-governance/use-university-name).
- Merchandise bearing the Penn name or marks must be produced by a licensed vendor (Business Services: https://www.business-services.upenn.edu/services/penn-branded-merchandise-licensing).
- Student groups using Penn names/insignia need approval from the Office of Student Affairs / VPUL (vpul-pennosa@pobox.upenn.edu).
- Logo use is authorized for University community members in applications supporting the University's mission; the University may deny uses harmful to its interests.

## 6. Reference files

Read these when the task touches their domain (don't read them otherwise):

- **`references/logos-and-lockups.md`** — every logo variant, department/school lockup rules, co-branding, restricted symbols, and the full do's & don'ts list.
- **`references/stationery-and-print.md`** — exact business card, letterhead, and envelope specs (dimensions, margins, type sizes, paper stock) for print deliverables.
- **`references/web-identity.md`** — central web identity details: palette proportions, typography pairings, required footer, and what not to copy from the homepage.

## 7. Quick checklist

Before delivering any Penn-branded artifact, verify:

- [ ] Red is exactly `#990000`; blue is exactly `#011F5B` (or print equivalents)
- [ ] Print deliverables use CMYK/PMS values; digital uses RGB/hex
- [ ] Web pages use EB Garamond (+ Roboto accents), not other serifs
- [ ] Logo is an official file, unmodified, in an allowed color treatment
- [ ] Web deliverables include the homepage link, logo, and five footer links
- [ ] Blue-dominant color balance; red and gold used deliberately, not liberally
